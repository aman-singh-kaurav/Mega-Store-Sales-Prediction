# Mega-Store-Sales-Prediction
BigMart/MegaStore Sales Prediction Project

__Objective:__ We have MegaStore dataset with both input and output variable(s). We need to predict the sales for test dataset.

__Hypotheses Generation__

It is always a good idea to generate some hypotheses before proceeding to any data science project.
We can separate this process into four levels: 
1. Product level 
2. Store level 
3. Customer level
4. Macro level
